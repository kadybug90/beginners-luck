# beginners-luck

hello fellow gamblers and as some of you will say non-gamblers,
i'd like to elaborate on my first master issue that was posted.
When i talk about gambling that doesnt necessarily mean betting money on any to see if the odds are with me or not.
I mean that everyday when we wake up we encounter a new challenge or acivity most are good lessons to learn, but there comes a few times when what were being faced with we're either not sure about or completely scared of the thought. But in the end we all must take a gamble to experience everythings out of life; and usually the first time we try something new the odds are in our favor but just because you walked away with a win the first go around doesnt mean fate will always happen that way.
